Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the most popular method for image recognition and has been applied to solve many real problems. In this chapter, we investigate problem of using the pre-trained CNNs for transfer learning. In particular, we fine-tune the parameters of the pre-trained CNNs on two food image database and achieve the improved results. We also investigate the changes of parameter after fine-tuning and try to obtain some important experience on fine-tuning the deep CNNs.
