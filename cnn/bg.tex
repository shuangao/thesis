Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the most popular method for image recognition and has been applied to solve many real problems. Different than the two methods we proposed, which use the output of the source model for knowledge transfer, in this chapter, we use the parameters of Deep CNNs as transferable knowledge and use it to initialize the Deep CNNs for our recognition task.

In this chapter, we investigate the problem of using the pre-trained CNNs for transfer learning. In particular, we fine-tune the parameters of the pre-trained CNNs on two food image database and achieve the improved results. We also investigate the changes of the parameters after fine-tuning and try to obtain some important experience on fine-tuning the deep CNNs.
