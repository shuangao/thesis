In this chapter, we propose a method, EMTLe that can effectively transfer the knowledge under the HTL setting. We focus on the effectiveness and compatibility issues for HTL problems. We propose our auxiliary bias strategy to let our model exploit the knowledge from different types of source classifiers. The transfer parameter of EMTLe is estimated by bi-level optimization method using our novel high-level objective function which allows our model to better exploit the knowledge from source models. Experiment results demonstrate that EMTLe can effectively transfer the knowledge even though the size of training data is extremely small.
