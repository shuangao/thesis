\chapter{Related Work}\label{sec:works}
In this chapter, we review some previous work related to ours. We first review the classifiers used in this thesis, providing the general concept and principle of how they work. Then we review the types of transfer learning for visual recognition from two different views and then discuss the previous work of how to alleviate negative transfer. Finally, we review some methods related to the 3 methods used in this thesis.
